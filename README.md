This is a demonstration of orbits using openGl and my own code, along with some boiler plate code from my CSCI 4229 class at CU Boulder

Credit for the help comes from my professor Willem A. (Vlakkies) Schreuder
His contributions at this time:
    - CSCIx2129.h
    - ercheck.c
    - fatal.c
    - loadobj.c
    - loadtexbmp.c
    - print.c
    - projection.c
    - Makefile

    - and some intital code inside orbits.c

I do intend on slowly removing these and creating my own but as a start I am using his help

To compile (on any system) run `make all`

To run, run the executable created from make all in general `./orbits` or `./orbits.exe`

to make clean run `make clean`
